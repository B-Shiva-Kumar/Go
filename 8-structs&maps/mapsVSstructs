Map: 

- All keys & values must be of same type.
- Keys are indexed, we can iterate over them.
- Use to represent a collection of related properties.
- Don't need to know all the keys at compile time.
- Maps are reference type.


Struct:

- Value can be of different type.
- keys don't support indexing.
- Need to know all the different fields at compile time.
- Use to represent a "thing" with a lot of different properties.
- Structs are valye type.
