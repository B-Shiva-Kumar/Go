What are Interfaces?

- An interface is a set of method signatures.
- When a type provides def. for all the methods in the interface, it is said to implement the interface.
- Interfaces are not "generic" types
- Interfaces in Go are set implicitly, so all you have to do is define the required methods on your type and it will qualify as implementing that interface.


- When we say that interfaces can be satisfied implicitly?
* we don't have to write extra code to say some stype satisfies an interface

- To say that a type satisfies an interface means that?
* type implements all of the functions contains in the interface def.
