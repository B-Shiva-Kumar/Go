Value Types:

- Use pointers to change these things in a function

int
float
string
bool
structs


References Types:

- No need of using Pointers

slices
maps
channels
pointers
functions


NOTE:

When we create a slice, Go will automatically create which two data structures?
-> An array & structure that records the length & capacity of the slice & reference to undelying array.

With 'value types' in Go, do we have to worry about pointers 
if we want to pass a value to a function and modify the original value inside the function?
-> Yes

With 'reference types' in Go, do we have to worry about pointers 
if we want to pass a value to a function and modify the original value inside the function?
-> No
