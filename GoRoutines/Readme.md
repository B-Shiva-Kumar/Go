Go Routines:

- Go language provides a special feature known as a Goroutines.
- A Goroutine is a function or method which executes independently and simultaneously in connection with any other Goroutines present in your program.
- Goroutine is a light weighted thread, The cost of creating Goroutines is very small as compared to the thread.
- Every program contains at least a single Goroutine and that Goroutine is known as the main Goroutine.
- All the Goroutines are working under the main Goroutines if the main Goroutine terminated, then all the goroutine present in the program also terminated.
- Goroutine always works in the background.
- parallel execution of the function thus over comes serial execution.
